PVCS Reloaded attempts to bring PVCS 1.3 (Atari 2600 emulator by BraveDog) back to life! It now
supports following devices:

:. Memory Card
:. USB Devices
:. CD/DVD
:. HDD

This version was converted to PS2SDK/GsKit by bootsector.

Thanks to the following people who (in)directly made this happen:

:. PS2SDK maintainers/developers
:. PS2DEV forum members (Lukasz and others)
:. ragnarok2040 for his menu component (used in FCEUltra for PS2)
:. dlanor and EP for LaunchElf and its source code
:. BraveDog for PVCS.
:. My lovely wife, Miriam, for letting me to spend some of our 
   valuable time with this ;)
   
This is a WIP project. There are still many features to be added!

Hope you folks enjoy it!
